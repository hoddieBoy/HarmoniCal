# Code of Conduct for HarmoniCal

## 1. Purpose
The primary goal of HarmoniCal is to facilitate collaborative, inclusive, and safe environments where individuals can
share ideas, improve their skills, and contribute to a wide array of project aspects without fear of harassment or
belittlement. This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for participant behavior as well as the consequences for
unacceptable behavior.

## 2. Open [Source/Culture/Tech] Citizenship
A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open [source/culture/tech] citizenship by encouraging
participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.
Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential for us to achieve a healthy and
sustainable community.

## 3. Expected Behavior
The following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:
 - Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this 
   community.
 - Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
 - Attempt collaboration before conflict.
 - Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
 - Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous
   situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.

## 4.Unacceptable Behavior
Unacceptable behaviors include: intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory, or demeaning speech or
actions by any participant in our community online, at all related events, and in one-on-one communications carried out
in the context of community business. Community event venues may be shared with members of the public; please be
respectful to all patrons of these locations.

Harassment includes: 
 - harmful or prejudicial verbal or written comments related to gender, sexual orientation, race,
   religion, disability
 - inappropriate use of nudity and/or sexual images in public spaces (including presentation slides)
 - deliberate intimidation, stalking or following

 - sustained disruption of talks or other events
 - inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

## 5. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior
Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not
be tolerated. Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem
appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without
refund in the case of a paid event).

## 6. Reporting Guidelines
If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a community
organizer as soon as possible. Additionally, community organizers are available to help community members engage with
local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe.

## 7. Addressing Grievances
If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify the project
maintainers with a concise description of your grievance. Your grievance will be handled in accordance with our existing
governing policies.

## 8. Scope
We expect all community participants (contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors; and other guests) to abide by this Code
of Conduct in all community venues—online and in-person—as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to
community business.
